Requirements:

Before running this project, make sure you have Python installed and that your project directory is marked as a source root (if using PyCharm) or run the command "pip install -e ." from the Emotion-Detection directory (if using other IDEs where the former isn't possible) so that local imports work correctly.

You must also have the following Python packages installed:

torch

torchvision

pandas

matplotlib

tabulate

pillow

seaborn

You can install all required packages using:

pip install torch torchvision pandas matplotlib tabulate pillow seaborn


Make sure to install the version of torch and torchvision that matches your system (CPU or GPU).

Also so you know most of these files took about 30 minutes to run.
