Hey guys so I know you probably wondering what models we can do
since most of the data exploration part is done.

I'm gonna put the link to a google doc here that is the data I got
from exploring. If you make a model make sure you use the config file that
has the training and validation data and then the test data. Look at my code and you
can see how I access the data.

1. Simple CNN:

Architecture example:

Conv → ReLU → MaxPool

Conv → ReLU → MaxPool

Flatten → Dense → Dropout → Softmax

Tune:

Learning rate

Dropout

Batch size

Why:
The dataset is big enough to train a small CNN but not a huge one.

2. If you want to try we haven't done this with images ,but maybe if we look at a couple videos we can understand it.

3. Data-Augmented Model (Very important)

Because we have only:

71 disgust

16 fear

9 contempt

we must use augmentation.

 Model G — Augmented MobileNetV2

Train the same model as before but with:

rotation range

brightness shifts

horizontal flips

zoom range

slight shifts

Why:
This reduces overfitting on tiny classes.
